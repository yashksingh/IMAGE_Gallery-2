# IMAGE_Gallery-2

## INTRODUCTION

Galleries are pages which contain large numbers of media content—almost always, images—with little or no supporting text. Large numbers of galleries have been deleted from Wikipedia per WP:NOT. This is usually cited in this context as WP:NOT an image gallery, which is a paraphrase of the official policy that Wikipedia articles are not mere collections of photographs or media files. This page defines how, when, and where gallery-articles should and should not be used. It is not concerned with the use of the gallery feature within pages that are predominantly text-based articles.

## BENEFITS

Benefits of galleries are disputed. There is general agreement that some galleries contribute important quality to the project but many do not. These benefits must be balanced against costs to determine if a gallery is warranted.

- Some topics are best illustrated by a gallery. As always, the best definition of a thing is the thing itself. Sometimes, one or even three images is not enough.
- Sometimes a gallery is a useful index into a large number of related articles. To claim this benefit, of course, each image in the gallery must link to a related article.
- The whole may be more than the sum of its parts. Occasionally, simply grouping a number of images together may reveal something of value to the reader, even if that value cannot be put into words. Common themes may unexpectedly appear—or expected themes fail to materialize.
- Projectspace galleries can be important tools, even if some images are never used outside of the gallery.
- Userspace galleries, like much userspace content, form part of the social glue that binds our community.

## FAIR USE

An important element of the fair use doctrine is ...the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.... In simple terms this means that copying one page from a comic book may be okay but copying 12 of them all at one time is probably not.

This element is extremely important when fair-use images are used in galleries. If one image, say, from a copyrighted book, is used in an article, it may be fair use. Then another image from the same book is used in another article and so on. If all of these images from the same book appear in a single gallery, it is almost certainly not fair use.

Another element of fair use suggests that it is acceptable to use copyrighted material to illustrate the subject of an article. So, it is fair use to illustrate Carl's Jr. with its own copyrighted Carl's Jr. logo. It is probably not fair use of that same image in Globalization.

Galleries may be on very shaky ground when it comes to fair use images. It's probably best to avoid them entirely and stick to public domain and freely licensed images.
